billscrape.py scrapes bills in the Georgia legislature

sankeygabills.py sorts bills into separate spreadsheets by their final status: like vetoed, passed one committee, signed by governor, etc.

index.html and associated files draw a Sankey diagram, mostly using D3.js.
The diagram shows what happens to bills in the Legislature.


The final product, after Photoshop annotation is at: http://greencracker.net/?p=2321
