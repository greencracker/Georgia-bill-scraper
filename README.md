# Georgia-bill-scraper

# A pair of files I run locally
# billscrape.py scrapes bills in the Georgia legislature
# sankeygabills.py sorts bills into separate spreadsheets by their final status: like 
# vetoed, passed one committee, signed by governor, etc.
# The point of it is to count the sorted bills and that summed & subtotaled data
# can be used to draw a sankey diagram.
